static char buffer[] -> aufm stack, freet sich slebst am ende

1. copy whole buffer into tmp
	set whole buffer array to \0

2. check tmp for \n

3.1 \n found:
		-> ft_substr -> ReturnValue
		-> ft_strlcpy -> buffer[]
		- set whole buffer array to \0 || why????
		- free tmp
		- tmp = NULL

3.2 \n not found:
		-> read into buffer[]
		-> strjoin tmp + buffer
		- set whole buffer array to \0
		- loop until \n is found (pt3)

ReturnVal: everything until including \n
buffer: rest after \n
