Uninitialized stash:
char *stash; is declared but never allocated before stash[0] = '\0';, which causes undefined behavior.

Memory leaks and incorrect allocation:
In copy_buffer, you allocate memory for stash and immediately overwrite its pointer with the result of ft_strjoin, leaking the original allocation.

Incorrect use of ft_strchr:
You use ft_strchr(buffer, '\n') == -1, but ft_strchr usually returns a pointer, not an index. If you wrote your own version, ensure it returns an index or fix the check.

Buffer handling:
The static buffer is not properly managed between calls, and the function does not handle partial lines or leftover data.

No handling for end-of-file:
If the last line doesn't end with a newline, it won't be returned.
